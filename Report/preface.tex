This master thesis is one part of a larger project with four other master thesis students at Alten Sweden. I first and foremost want to thank each and every one of this group: Daniel Roshanghias, Erik Lerander, Hanna Hellman and Sanel Ferhatovic. I also want to thank Youssef Zaki, whose work this thesis is largely based on. Lastly I want to thank Detlef Scholle and Alten for the opportunity to conduct my master thesis at Alten.
