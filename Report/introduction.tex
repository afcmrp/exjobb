\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This chapter will introduce the subject of mixed criticality embedded systems and the EU project "EMC\textsuperscript{2}" to the reader.

\section{Background}
%, around 100 electric motors and 2 km of wiring
Today, modern automotive systems contain approximately 70-100 Electric Control Units (ECUs)~\cite{lemke2012}. Each ECU controls a subsystem of a specific criticality level such as safety-critical anti-lock brake system, or non-critical entertainment systems \cite{weber2015}. Having the ECUs isolated ensures that the numerous critical and non-critical applications do not interfere with each other, making it relatively easy to certify an individual ECU. However, this approach leads to an inefficient use of system resources and expensive system implementation \cite{burns2016}. In order to lower the cost of the collective system and increase system efficiency (utilization), applications of different criticality levels can be integrated into a single hardware platform, leading to a Mixed Criticality System (MCS). However, this approach increases system complexity, and hinders the certification of safety-critical systems \cite{zaki2016}. To enable design, test, and certification of MCS, spatial and temporal partitioning can be used in the architecture of the system.\\

Protecting the integrity of a component from the faults of another is desired in all systems hosting multiple applications. However, it is of higher significance if the different applications have different criticality levels. Without such protection all components on the same system would need to be engineered to the standards of the highest criticality level, potentially massively increasing development costs \cite{burns2016}.\\

With cars being increasingly connected to the internet, security poses another concern for MCS. If one part of a system is easier to attack, the entire system could be compromised if proper isolation is not in place.\\

The EU project "Embedded Multi-Core systems for Mixed Criticality applications in dynamic and changeable real-time environments" (EMC\textsuperscript{2}) was founded in order to "find solutions for dynamic adaptability in open systems, provide handling of mixed criticality applications under real-time conditions, scalability and utmost flexibility, full scale deployment and management of integrated tool chains, through the entire lifecycle" \cite{weber2015}. 

\subsection{Definition of safety-critical systems}
The term "safety-critical system" has many definitions, most quite similar. Most definitions relate to systems with the potential to harm humans if the system malfunctions. According to \cite{website:encyclopedia} it is defined as "A system in which any failure or design error has the potential to lead to loss of life." Further, \cite{website:dictionary} defines safety-critical systems as "A computer, electronic or electromechanical system whose failure may cause injury or death to human beings." A Wikipedia article, \cite{website:wikipedia}, defines a safety-critical system (or "life-critical system") as a system whose failure or malfunction may result in one (or more) of the following outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
\item death or serious injury to people
\item loss or severe damage to equipment/property
\item environmental harm
\end{itemize}
In this thesis, a safety-critical system will be defined as "a system whose failure may cause injury or death to human beings."

\subsection{Different levels of criticality}
Different names of levels of criticality are typically Safety Integrity Level (SIL), Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) and Development Assurance Level (DAL). The IEC 61508 standard \cite{IEC61508} defines four different levels and the ISO 26262 standard \cite{ISO26262} and the DO-178C standard \cite{DO178C} define five different levels each. These levels range from low or no hazard up to life-threatening or fatal in the event of a malfunction requiring the highest level of assurance that the dependent safety goals are sufficient and have been achieved.\\
%It should be noted that not all standards and papers on MCS assign to "criticality" the same meaning, an issue  explored by  Graydon and Bate [141], Esper et al. [123] and Paulitsch et al. [256]

The number of criticality levels in the implementation part of this thesis will be restricted to two: "safety-critical" and "non-critical". This is due to the constraints presented in section \ref{sec:mces} and \ref{sec:scope}.

\subsection{Alten Mixed Criticality System}
\label{sec:mces}
As a part of the EMC\textsuperscript{2} project, Alten has developed a system for handling applications of mixed criticality on the same piece of hardware, Alten MCS. The MCS developed at Alten has been implemented on two development boards, the Zedboard (Zynq Evaluation and Development board) and the EMC\textsuperscript{2} Development Platform, or EMC\textsuperscript{2}DP. Both boards have a Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC~\cite{website:xilinx}. Alten MCS employs two operating systems to handle applications of different criticality. A General Purpose Operating System (GPOS) for non-critical applications and a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for safety-critical applications. A hypervisor is used to alternate between the two. For more information, see chapter \ref{sec:lit_emc2mcs}.

\subsection{Platooning}
\label{sec:platooning}
Platooning is the concept of several vehicles driving coordinated with short intermediate distances in order to reduce air friction for the collective platoon. Platooning puts high requirements on the control systems in the platooning vehicles, since failure of these systems could have fatal consequences. Some expected advantages of platooning include increased fuel and traffic efficiency, safety and driver comfort~\cite{bergenhem}.

\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:problem}
%Implement safety-critical controller on the embedded system.
An ideal MCS ensures partitioning between different criticality levels while still sharing resources efficiently. This leads to the underlying research question:
\begin{itemize}
\item "How, in a disciplined way, to reconcile the conflicting requirements of partitioning for safety assurance and sharing for efficient resource usage?" \cite{burns2016}
\end{itemize}
The MCS developed at Alten switches Operative System (OS) via a hypervisor to enable partitioning between safety-critical and non-critical applications, which takes about 2 $\mu s$. This means that at higher switching frequencies the mode switch takes up more processor time, potentially making up almost all processor time at very high frequencies.\\

To evaluate the performance of the system, a distance keeping control algorithm for platooning will be implemented on it. A demonstrator will be constructed in the form of a RC car capable of following a vehicle in front of it at a specified distance. If the lead car exceeds a predefined maximum speed or deviates from the road, the following car should not exceed the maximum speed. It should be verified that no matter the computational load and eventual crashes of the Linux based non-critical system, the distance keeping algorithm on the RTOS should never crash.\\

This problem leads to the research question: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Is virtualization an efficient approach when trying to reconcile the conflicting requirements of partitioning for safety assurance and sharing for efficient resource usage when implementing a safety-critical control system?
\end{itemize}

This thesis will attempt at answering this question by doing a state of the art study in the research topic, implement a safety-critical system on a mixed criticality platform and evaluate the results. 

\section{Purpose}
Reducing the amount of computers in automotive systems would have many effects. Manufacturing costs would decrease and with fewer physical components maintenance costs would also decrease. However, the system complexity would increase and thereby increasing time and cost to design the system. \\

SafeCOP (Safe Cooperating Cyber-Physical Systems) is an European project that targets cyberphysical systems-of-systems whose safe cooperation relies on wireless communication~\cite{safecop2016}. SafeCOPs Use Case 3 (UC3) regarding "Vehicle control loss warning" together with the EMC2 goals tie well in with the problem statement and use case described in~\ref{sec:problem}. 

\section{Goals}
In this project there are both team goals and individual goals that do not always necessarily align with each other.

\subsection{Team goal}
The team consists of five master thesis students. The students areas of work are: control theory and system modeling, data aggregation, safety-critical communication in MCS, lane detection and finally safety-critical control in MCS. Together the team will build a vehicle capable of following a vehicle ahead of it while keeping inside road markers.

\subsection{Individual goal}
Verify quantitatively the performance of safety-critical distance keeping controller, see section~\ref{sec:research}. Solve the problems described in section~\ref{sec:problem}.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}
%TODO: How much can the result be generalized?
The work of this thesis and the implementation on the demonstrator will build upon the work of Youssef Zaki\cite{zaki2016}.\\

The embedded computer is constrained to the Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC \cite{website:xilinx}. The hypervisor used is constrained to SafeG~\cite{website:safeg} and the RTOS is constrained to FMP~\cite{website:fmp}. 

%The architecture of the cooperative adaptive cruise control algorithm will be designed by Daniel Roshanghias.\\

%The lane detection and lateral control will be developed by Sanel Ferhatovic.

%\section{Method}
%Implement control algorithm on MCS. The demonstrator should follow a similar vehicle at a specified distance. Also position control with stationary target. Control system performance and embedded controller performance will be evaluated for both MCS and dedicated.
\section{Research design}
\label{sec:research}
%TODO: verify source
%Deductive approach
The plan is to conduct a confirmatory investigation using quantitative data/operations with a deductive approach. This is a quantitative research method. \cite{hakansson2013}.\\ % where data is gathered during experiments and from simulations of the environment %Gather data from simulations and from real tests, iterated many times.

%TODO: Kanske bättre i en annan del?
%The position of the demonstrator will be read by a separate sensor of the same type as the one on the demonstrator. The performance of the control system and the embedded controller will be measured and compared with the same system without any non-critical computational load. This will also be done for a simulation of the system. The measures regarding control system performance will consist of 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Response time
%\item Overshoot
%\item Settling time
%\end{itemize}

%Data points for the performance of the embedded controller will be extracted from the RTOS, and the measures will consist of
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Missed deadlines
%\item CPU utilization
%\end{itemize}

\section{Ethical considerations}
When designing a MCS it is crucial to ensure that errors made by a lower criticality application cannot propagate to higher criticality applications, as this could have catastrophic consequences. Because of this the requirement of partitioning must have higher priority than the need of sharing resources.

%\section{Thesis structure}
