\chapter{Future work}
This chapter will contain thoughts and ideas for future work building on this thesis or in the area of MCS in general.

\section{Using virtualization}
Facilitate for more than two different criticality levels.

Examine different scheduling methods. %TODO: Ge exempel

\section{Using other means of partitioning}
Examine limitations for other configurations of MCS, for example different CPUs for different criticality levels.

\section{Economical benefits for pursuing MCS in various industries}
It is not clear how much the potential economical benefit would be from pursuing MCS. The economical impacts of MCS might be different in different industries. It must be calculated more exactly how large the potential benefits would be to gauge the need for pursuing MCS.
