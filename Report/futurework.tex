\chapter{Future work}
This chapter will contain thoughts and ideas for future work building on this thesis or in the area of MCS in general.

\section{MCS using virtualization}
Facilitate for more than two different criticality levels.

Examine different scheduling methods. %TODO: Ge exempel

\section{MCS using other means of partitioning}
Examine limitations for other configurations of MCS, for example different CPUs for different criticality levels.

\section{Amount of criticality levels}
Research should be done to investigate how many different levels of criticality, $n$, to have on MCSs in different industries. In the automotive for example, $n$ should be between 1 and 5 since ISO26262 defines 5 different ASILs. If the applications are spread uniformly across all criticality levels it might be of higher interest to have $n$ closer to 5. Similarly, if the applications are heavily concentrated on a certain criticality level $n$ probably should be closer to 2.

\section{Economical benefits for pursuing MCS}
It is not clear how much the potential economical benefit would be from pursuing MCS. The economical impacts of MCS might be different in different industries. It must be calculated more exactly how large the potential benefits would be to gauge the need for pursuing MCS.
