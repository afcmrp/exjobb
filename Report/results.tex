\chapter{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This chapter will present results from the demonstrator to the reader.

Things to evaluate: Overhead, memory usage, security stuff, economical benefit

\section{Experiment design}
Timer setup, etc

\section{SafeG overhead}

From TOPPERS: 1.7 $\mu s$

Using only safeg\_syscall\_switch():

Samples: 323
WCET: 2.68 $\mu s$
BCET: 0.98 $\mu s$
Average ET: 1.63 $\mu s$
Median: 1.72 $\mu s$
STdev: 0.258 $\mu s$

Task switch introduces extra 1.18 $\mu s$. Combined WCET: $3.86 \mu s$.

Unregistered exception was possible to create by accessing restricted AXI bus address, causing the processor to stop.
