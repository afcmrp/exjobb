\chapter{Discussion}
Discussion about the results produced by the thesis.

\section{Information retrieval}
Printing to SYSLOG takes time and affects the system that's being monitored.

Timer used requires very little processor time, but still some. TOPPERS might have measured using less processor time.

\section{Utilization}
Deterministic system - work towards 100\%, anything under that: reduce clock frequency to reduce power consumption and reach 100\%.\\

Sporadic system - probably want to be around ~50\% utilization to maintain 100\% schedulability, higher depending on requirements on performance versus requirements on efficiency.

\section{Errors}
Unregistered exception, accessing restricted AXI bus address. Should be avoided by accessing via OS instead of address. All address space should be handled by the OS/monitor, allowing or restricting access to certain address spaces. Probably not correctly setup.
