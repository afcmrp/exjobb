\chapter{Discussion}
Discussion about the results produced by the thesis.

\section{Information retrieval}
Printing to SYSLOG takes time and affects the system that's being monitored.

\section{Utilization}
Deterministic system - work towards 100\%, anything under that: reduce clock frequency to reduce power consumption and reach 100\%.\\

Sporadic system - probably want to be around ~50\% utilization to maintain 100\% schedulability, higher depending on requirements on performance versus requirements on efficiency.

\section{Errors}
Unregistered exception, accessing restricted AXI bus address.
