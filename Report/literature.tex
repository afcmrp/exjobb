\section{Current system}
%Describe current system more in depth.
The EMC2DB uses two operating systems, a RTOS for safety-critical applications and a GPOS for non-critical applications. A Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) is used to alternate between safety-critical RTOS and non-critical GPOS. The RTOS is TOPPERS FMP kernel \cite{website:FMP}, and the GPOS is a custom modified Linux distribution. The VMM used is SafeG \cite{website:safeg}. It switches processor state via a hardware switch. A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) as interface between processor and board. %TODO: Expand!

An overview of the system can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:introduction_overview}.
